# Generalizing Across Gravity in Lunar Lander

- Generalization across environments (different gravity constants)

- Gravity Constant can be in between 0 and -12

-> Extrapolation in one dimension
    -> Training Set has values between 0 and -8
    -> Validation set has values between -8 and -12


- Also set the training gravity as hyperparemeter

-> Learning Rate and Gravity are the most important hyper parameters using fanova
-> The environment is not solved after around 40 trials in the evaluation across the different gravities (best incumbant was around 70)
-> I used 5 Evaluations across 4 different gravity constants, could also be to noisy in order to be a good evaluation metric, meaning the 70 was by chance only
-> The environment also was not really solved in the training data, therefore one should maybe increase training time a bit, or introduce some early stopping of new increase is visible anymore

-> Should rerun the experiment with more computational ressources using different seeds for each step, more evaluation trajectories and maybe a few more hyperparameters (including network size, etc.)
